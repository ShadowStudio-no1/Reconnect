This is a placeholder text file. Please replace it with an actual JPEG image file named "placeholder.jpg" in this same directory.

For the best results, use a simple silhouette image of a person with dimensions approximately 300x300 pixels.

You can find free placeholder silhouette images on sites like:
- https://www.pexels.com/search/silhouette/
- https://unsplash.com/s/photos/silhouette
- https://pixabay.com/images/search/silhouette/

After downloading an appropriate image, rename it to "placeholder.jpg" and place it in this directory.

Note: The application is currently using a data URI embedded in the JavaScript code as a fallback for the placeholder image, but having an actual file here will prevent unnecessary 404 errors and improve performance.
