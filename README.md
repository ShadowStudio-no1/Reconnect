# Reconnect - Bringing Families Together

A compassionate web platform dedicated to reuniting missing persons, orphaned children, homeless individuals, and those separated from their families with their loved ones.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for displaying information about missing persons, orphaned children, and homeless individuals
- Searchable database with filters for location, age, category, and date
- Registration form for adding new individuals to the system
- Dark mode for better accessibility and user comfort
- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices



## Running the Application

### Client-side Only (Basic Demo)

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser to run the client-side application.

### Full Functionality with Server

For full functionality, including saving data to the persons.json file and storing images in the img folder, you need to run the server:

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (version 12 or higher)
2. Install required packages by running:
   ```
   npm install express fs path body-parser cors
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```
4. The server will start on http://localhost:3000
5. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to use the application with full functionality

When running with the server:
- Person registrations will be saved to `data/persons.json`
- Uploaded images will be stored in the `img` folder
- All data will persist between sessions

## File Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `css/styles.css` - Main stylesheet
- `js/main.js` - Main JavaScript file
- `data/persons.json` - JSON data for persons
- `data/institutions.json` - JSON data for institutions
- `img/` - Directory for images
- `server.js` - Server for handling file operations

## Dark Mode

Toggle between light and dark mode using the moon/sun icon in the header.

## Development

This project uses:
- HTML5
- CSS3 with CSS Variables for theming
- Vanilla JavaScript
- FontAwesome for icons
- Google Fonts for typography
- Express.js for the server (optional)

## License

This project is for humanitarian purposes and is freely available for use by relevant organizations.

## Customization and Extension

To customize the platform:

1. Modify `css/styles.css` to change the appearance
2. Edit `js/main.js` to alter functionality
3. Update `index.html` to change content and structure

## Production Considerations

For a production deployment:

1. Implement proper backend with database storage
2. Set up user authentication and authorization
3. Implement image upload and storage
4. Add form validation and security measures
5. Consider internationalization for multiple languages
6. Implement analytics to track usage and success rates
